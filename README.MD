# Fun Fact Generator

## Overview

This project was part of my software development apprenticeship program.  The requirement was to design and build an application involving CRUD routes.  The front end was built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.  The back-end was built in Node.js with Express and is connected to a MongoDB databse.  I was given creative freedom in choosing the idea for the application, and the inspiration for the application came from my love for fun facts.  The Fun Facts Generator was entirely designed and built by me, making it a full-stack web application that I was the sole contributor on.
